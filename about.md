# About This Project

This repository aims to gather theoretical proposals of qLDPC codes from the scientific literature. Each code is characterized by its parameters:

- n: total number of data qubits
- k: number of logical qubits
- d: code distance
- n_a: number of ancilla qubits

## Contributing
